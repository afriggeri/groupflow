Tool to layout temporal sequences of (overlapping) groups

  * each edge represent a person
  * each square is a group
  * each row is a time

Several random methods are implemented to ease the layout

  * arrows on the right of each row minimize up/down crossings
  * arrows in each group minimize the local/global up/down crossings of each groups
